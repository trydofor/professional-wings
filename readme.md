## 3.Powered by Love

All `SNAPSHOT`s are in development, `rollup` iteration, `gitflow` conventions.
All `feature` branches are named after the `dota2` hero,
about 1 push/week, 1 iteration/month, keep the last 2 branches.

Codes and docs use `github` as the main site and `gitee` as the mirror,
basically synchronized push.

* issues - task like action, such as bugs and features
* discussions - doc, tech topics, no political, religious discussions.
* PR and Review - PR will be reviewed and merged as the gitflow process

We will keep contributor and footprint as much as possible,
such as @author comments, code comments, commit information, etc.
